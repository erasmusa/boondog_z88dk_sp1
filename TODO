1. Create a Makefile recipe that
    1. Creates the local /opt/z88dk folder if it doesn't exist
    2. Run a z88dk container that mounts this /opt/z88dk folder to /mnt/ in the container
    3. Run a command taht cp -r /opt/z88dk/* in container to /mnt/ in container to

This will basically copy the z88dk toolchain from the container into the workspace

>>>> DONE

make z88dk-include will update the z88dk include files
